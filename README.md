This repository contains my personal LaTeX packages.

* mh_basic.sty: Sets up fonts and language, works with pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX. Also defines some refformats for the prettyref package.
* mh_math.sty: Loads my favourite math typesetting packages and defines a couple of useful commands.
* mh_theorems.sty: Theorem environment definitions, uses the ntheorem package.
* mh_tikz.sty: Some tikz definitions (not really useful yet).
* unikoblenzlogo.sty: Defines the command \unikoblenzlogo which typesets the logo of the university of Koblenz.

There is also a class and a package for typesetting exercise sheets:
* mhexsheet.cls: Flexible class for exercise typesetting. See the examples in mhex-examples directory.
* mhex.sty: Defines environments "exercise" and "solution", can be used independently of mhexsheet.cls.

An older version of the exercise sheet class is contained in the agopt_ex directory.
