This repository contains my personal LaTeX classes.

* mh_basic.sty: Sets up fonts and language, works with both (pdf)LaTeX and XeTeX. Also defines some refformats for the prettyref package.
* mh_math.sty: Loads my favourite math typesetting packages and defines a couple of useful commands.
* mh_theorems.sty: Theorem environment definitions, uses the ntheorem package.
* mh_tikz.sty: Some tikz definitions (not really useful yet).

There is also a package for typesetting exercise sheets in the agopt_ex directory, and a new version consisting of mhexsheet.cls and mhex.sty in the base directory.
