The agopt_ex package

The agopt_ex package is an aid to generate exercise sheets for the AG Optimization, TU Kaiserslautern,
or nowadays also the University of Koblenz.

To create the package (.sty file), run:

  latex agopt_ex.ins

To compile the documentation (pdf file), run

  pdflatex agopt_ex.dtx

(the package needs te be created beforehand). Use the "compile_package.sh" script
to do all in one step; this will also handle index generation.

See the package documentation and/or the example folders for how to use this package.
