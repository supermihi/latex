\maketitle



For in-class exercise sheets, specify \verb|date| instead of \verb|deadline| in the setup; this will also change the caption in the title section.

If there's both in-class and take-home exercises on the same sheet, you can specify both \verb|date| and \verb|deadline| and use the commands \verb|\inclass| and \verb|\takehome| to mark the different sections in the exercise sheet.
\inclass

\begin{exercise}
Bla
\end{exercise}


\takehome
\begin{exercise}[title=Lemma of Zorn,points=100]
Blabla
\end{exercise}
